# TestDriveSelenium
Focused on test automation with **Selenium**, showcasing **DDT**  (**data-driven testing**) by separating **test logic** from **test data**.  

---

## At a Glance
✅ Writing automated UI tests using Selenium WebDriver  
⚙️ Applying **DDT** for maintainable test design  
📝 Organizing tests with **POM** (Page Object Model)  
📊 Following QA best practices : readability, modularity, reusability  
🎯 Portfolio-ready demonstration of professional test automation practices  


## Tech Stack
Language : Python  
Automation frameworks : Selenium WebDriver, Robot Framework  
IDE : PyCharm  
Test runner : Pytest (for Selenium) / Robot Framework built-in runner  
Data sources : CSV / Excel / JSON (for Data-Driven Testing)

## Notes
**Data-driven test automation practices** applied to a CRM environment (Salesforce).  
The project has been **anonymized and generalized** for educational and portfolio purposes :  
-- All test data is fictitious  
-- Workflows are generic, inspired by standard Salesforce scenarios (login, case management, navigation)  
-- The focus is on **test design, automation techniques and maintainability**, not on reproducing a production environment
