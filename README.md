# TestDriveSelenium
TestDriveSelenium is focused on test automation with **Selenium**.   
The main goal is to showcase how to implement **DDT** (**data-driven testing**) by separating the **test logic** from the **test data**.  

This project demonstrates :  
- Writing **automated UI tests** using Selenium WebDriver   
- Applying the **DDT** (Data-Driven Testing approach)  
- Organizing tests with the **POM** (Page Object Model) for maintainability  
- Following **QA best practices** : readability, modularity, reusability  

## Tech Stack
Language : Python  
Automation frameworks : Selenium WebDriver, Robot Framework  
IDE : PyCharm  
Test runner : Pytest (for Selenium) / Robot Framework built-in runner  
Data sources : CSV / Excel / JSON (for Data-Driven Testing)  
Application under test : Salesforce (CRM platform)  
Design pattern : POM for maintainability  

## Notes
This repository demonstrates **data-driven test automation practices** applied to a CRM environment (Salesforce).  
The project has been **anonymized and generalized** for educational and portfolio purposes :  
-- All test data is fictitious  
-- Workflows are generic, inspired by standard Salesforce scenarios (login, case management, navigation)  
-- The focus is on **test design, automation techniques and maintainability**, not on reproducing a production environment
